PURPOSE
To provide list of materials used in the process of designing the application.

-   Modeling Relational Data with Cosmos DB
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28hLwxf3BWA
    Explains how to properly design Cosmos DB with relational data.
    -   Love partitions
    -   id==pk for top level entities
    -   keep everything in one container
    -   split entities into two documents (one that holds details and the other that contains partition keys that allow queries to go a dedicated partition)
-   Modeling and partitioning a real-world example on Azure Cosmos DB
