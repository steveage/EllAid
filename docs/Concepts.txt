PURPOSE
    To list design elements worth evaluating for inclusion in the project.

-   Add AppInsights logging and access it from Azure Monitor.
-   Check hosting web service in a container.
-   Use Azure DevOps.
-   Use Blazor instead of Angular.
-   CQRS pattern for data access from the repository.
-   Use MediatR framework to support CQRS pattern.
-   Consider adding architecture diagram on git readme similar to:

-   Use normal object model by adding behavior to data objects.
Advantage: That will make the objects resemble real world objects and behaviors.
Disadvantage: Might not be possible to use dependency injection easily. Complex object graphs will require either factories or accessing IOC container outside of the composition root.
-   Refactor by changing switch statements into polymorphic dispatchers.
